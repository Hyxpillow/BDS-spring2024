You can skip steps 1 and 2 because "./download/raw.csv" is already downloaded

1.  ```python3 ./download/download.py```
2.  ```python3 ./download/actors.py```
Now we get "./download/raw.csv"
2. ```python3 ./preprocess/main.py```

Now preprocessing has finished, you can check  "./figures/" and "./datasets"
